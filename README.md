# mysql-csv-load

[Ler em PortuguÃªs do Brasil](README.pt-BR.md)

This is a simple Python script to load data from a CSV file into a MySQL database table.

## Features

- Reads a CSV file specified as a command-line argument.
- Creates a table in the MySQL database with the same name as the CSV file (without the extension).
- The table columns are created dynamically based on the CSV file header.
- Inserts the data from the CSV file into the newly created table.

## How to use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/mysql-csv-load.git
   cd mysql-csv-load
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the database credentials:**

   Open the `main.py` file and change the following variables with your MySQL credentials:

   ```python
   conn = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="localhost",  # Change to your database host
       user="root",       # Change to your MySQL user
       password="root",   # Change to your MySQL password
       database="m"      # Change to your database name
   )
   ```

4. **Run the script:**

   Run the script from the command line, passing the path to your CSV file as an argument:

   ```bash
   python main.py path/to/your/file.csv
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   python main.py examples/customer_data.csv
   ```

   The script will create a table called `customer_data` (if it doesn't already exist) and insert the data from the CSV file into it.

## Example

Suppose you have a `products.csv` file with the following content:

```csv
ID,Name,Price
1,Product A,19.99
2,Product B,29.99
3,Product C,39.99
```

When running the command:

```bash
python main.py products.csv
```

The script will:

1. Connect to your MySQL database.
2. Create a table called `products` with the columns `ID`, `Name`, and `Price`.
3. Insert the 3 rows of data from the CSV file into the `products` table.

## Requirements
